# Monster0506's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, configured to my tastes.
Feel free to copy, change, remove, or ignore these. 

## Installation

Please do not install these files without understanding what they do or 
what they are intended for. These files are mainly intended for setting up
a new installation. 

To use, run `./bootstrap.sh` in the directory in which you cloned 
or downloaded this repository.

## Follow-up Steps

Make sure to source ~/.bashrc `. ~/.bashrc`

## Contents

I keep a pretty minimal configuration, but if I find something that I like, I
often add it to my dotfiles for later usage.

As a shell, I use bash with the [starship](https://starship.rs) prompt, and,
as such, there is a starship configuration file there. I don't often change those settings.
