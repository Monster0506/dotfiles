# VIM

I am a user of [Space ViM](https://spacevim.org/), which is a community-driven Vim distribution, and, as such, is built around a `init.toml` file, commonly located at `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.toml`.

This file automatically installs "plugins", or Vim extensibility services, as well as controls specific [layers](https://spacevim.org/layers/) or collections of related packages that work together to provide a heightened user experience. 

## File Locations

- [init.toml](init.toml) and [spell/](spell/) should be in the .SpaceVim.d/ directory.
- All other directories and files should be placed in .SpaceVim/

## Plugins
I have very few installed plugins beyond what is enabled in SpaceVim layers, but those are the following:

- [Vim Polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot)
- [Vim Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
- [Vim Indent Guides](https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides)
- [Vim Css Color](https://github.com/ap/vim-css-color)
- [Vim Argwrap](https://github.com/foosoft/vim-argwrap)

## Layers

- [Version Control](https://spacevim.org/layers/VersionControl/)
- [Shell](https://spacevim.org/layers/shell/)
- [Autocomplete](https://spacevim.org/layers/autocomplete/)
